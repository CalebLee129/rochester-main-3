              <h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
              <p>We aimed to gain insight into how a carbon-negative energy source could benefit the Rochester community, particularly in terms of health and financial impact.</p>
              <h4><strong>Stakeholder Response</strong></h4>
              <p>When discussing his experience as a Rochester City planner, he mentioned that if our project successfully reduces CO2 levels in the atmosphere, it could significantly improve the health and quality of life for Rochester residents. He also emphasized that diversifying the community’s energy sources would make Rochester more resilient to climate change. We then asked how we could gain support from residents and local organizations for implementing our project. He suggested that we clearly demonstrate how the project will specifically improve their lives, such as providing concrete numbers on how quickly the investment would pay for itself—whether in months or years. When asked about the most pressing challenges facing the Rochester community, he identified cost as a major concern, noting that many residents cannot afford the upfront expense of installing green energy alternatives like solar panels. To address this, he advised that our solution must be “affordable, low-maintenance, and accessible to people in all income brackets.” Additionally, given that our project involves cyanobacteria and new techniques unfamiliar to most people, he stressed the importance of thoroughly explaining the safety aspects of our project. He expressed confidence that our project has the potential to help wean the community off fossil fuels.</p>
              <h4><strong>Action Plan</strong></h4>
              <p>If we implement our project, we will clearly communicate the benefits of carbon-negative energy and the reduction of CO2 emissions to the public. We will address cost concerns by exploring funding options and offering financial assistance to reduce upfront costs for lower-income residents. Additionally, we will thoroughly explain the safety measures associated with using cyanobacteria through brochures, informational sessions with the community, and engagement with local media to reach a broader audience.</p>

                <h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
                <p>To create immediate local impact that set the stage for our technology adoption by larger institutions, it is crucial to test out our technology on a smaller and more familiar scale like our university. Thus, an interview with a faculty member in our school is essential to learn more about our university resources such as experts and facilities.</p>
                <h4><strong>Stakeholder Response</strong></h4>
                <p>Ms Berger emphasized the potential value of BPV technology in contributing to the university’s energy goals. Since the university has ⅓ of electricity powered by natural gas and the remaining energy comes from solar and geothermal sources, our goal of creating carbon-negative energy sources would be a positive account for the university. Her other suggestions include exploring spaces on-campus, sustainability metrics, as well as focus on the long term impact of our device.</p>
                <h4><strong>Action Plan</strong></h4>
                <p>Based on her feedback, we plan to conduct a life cycle assessment and carbon analysis to measure our technology efficiency and carbon emission. Additionally, we talked to the hardware team to design our biophotovoltaic cell to allow for easy separation of components.</p>
                <h4><strong>Future Steps</strong></h4>
                <p>If we were to implement our project, we plan on integrating our technology in parking lots to form covering for snowy areas. This will help us to best utilize our campus limited space.</p>

          <h3 id="Kristen">Dr Kristin Doughty</h3>
            <p>As an anthropologist from the University of Rochester, Professor Doughty offers valuable guidance in navigating potential economic and cultural challenges with our technology. She gave us thought-provoking questions on how to engage communities and align our goals with both public and private sector. This knowledge is crucial to ensure that our biophotovoltaic cells are socially equitable, environmentally friendly, scalable and sustainable.</p>

                <h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
                <p>We reached out to anthropology professor Kristin Doughty to gain a deep understanding of the socio-cultural and economic factors that might influence the success of biophotovoltaic technology.</p>
                <h4><strong>Stakeholder Response</strong></h4>
                <p>Instead of providing specific recommendations, Professor Doughty posed several thought-provoking questions, which are foundational for assessing the socio-cultural implications of our technology. This includes the differences between microgrid and national grid, optimal times for power generation, energy storage capacity, infrastructure needs, and distribution logistics, etc. She urged us to clarify whether we are primarily solving a social, economic, or environmental problem. She ended the interview by saying “If power is entirely privatized, we end up with the Elon Musk problem” which encourages us to involve the public sector in our project deployment. </p>
                <h4><strong>Action Plan</strong></h4>
                <p>Her input suggests that our policy and practice team should collaborate closely with other sub-teams to address these key questions. More details on this will be provided in the Reflection and Proposed Implementation section of our Human Practice page.</p>
                <h4><strong>Future Steps</strong></h4>
                <p>If our project moves forward, we will seek support from government and non-profit organizations to help establish regulations, ensuring that our energy solution benefits everyone and avoids being monopolized by the wealthy.</p>

                <h4><strong>Stakeholder Response</strong></h4>
                <p>Ms McHugh Grifa highlighted the need for collective action, creating solutions with others rather than focusing solely on individual efforts to implement more impactful solutions. Furthermore, she stressed the importance to reform the current business model and energy infrastructure, as the outdated grid is not equipped to handle new energy sources. Finally, she addressed the misconception that new technologies need to be flawless, while pointing out the inherent challenges of current energy sources. Therefore, she advised us to focus on our overall positive impact and ensure that it can outweigh these issues.</p>
                <h4><strong>Action Plan</strong></h4>
                <p>The interview encouraged us to focus on the sustainability efforts, such as explaining to other stakeholders and the end-users the benefits of biophotovoltaic technology and how it can contribute towards Rochester climate action goals.</p>
                <h4><strong>Future Steps</strong></h4>
                <p>If we were to implement our project, we would reach out to other local organizations such as the Genesee Finger Lakes Climate Collective to introduce our biophotovoltaic cell, as well as develop a long-term commercialization strategy to enter the renewable energy market. We will explore funding options that support grid updates and design a a new business model for energy distribution.</p>
