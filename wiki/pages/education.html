   <p>Overview - Team CyanoVolt organized a series of educational activities for the Rochester community and a global audience. We centered our outreach on creativity and environmental themes, reflecting our project's focus on the climate crisis. Through both in-person and online engagement, we connected with over 4,000 individuals. CyanoVolt aims to demonstrate how synthetic biology can be integrated into everyday life, inspiring the public to embrace creativity and realize that anything is possible!
   </p>


<h1 id="Synbio"><strong>SynBio Innovation Challenge</strong></h1>
 <p>Overview - To extend our outreach beyond the Rochester community, Team CyanoVolt launched the “SynBio Innovation Challenge,” a global initiative for high school students to explore the field of synthetic biology. Participants were tasked with presenting their own mini iGEM project pitches, allowing them to dive into current synthetic biology advancements while identifying and addressing real-world problems that they are passionate about solving.</p>

   <p>To promote the challenge, we utilized Instagram Advertising, reaching over 1,800 users worldwide with a post that linked directly to our sign-up form. All participants were invited to join a Google Classroom, providing a centralized platform for communication between the students and our team. This space housed essential materials, including the project rubric, lecture slides, and Zoom meeting details, ensuring everyone had easy access to the necessary resources. <br>
   We carefully designed the project rubric to reflect the key elements we prioritized in our own work. This included identifying a significant problem, proposing a solution that offers clear advantages over existing ones, incorporating synthetic biology into the solution, considering the ethical implications of the project using accurate and reliable supporting evidence, clearly communicating ideas, and showcasing creativity and innovation.<br>
   During our introductory meeting, we covered foundational concepts and applications of synthetic biology to help students grasp the basics. Our primary goal was to demystify synthetic biology by explaining that it involves engineering an organism’s genes to bestow it with the traits and functions of another. To inspire confidence, we shared our project’s early presentation, emphasizing that most of our team members had no prior background in synthetic biology, proving that anyone can learn and contribute to this field.<br>
   Additionally, we hosted office hours and encouraged students to reach out via email with any questions or concerns. This approach was designed to foster open, two-way communication throughout the challenge.

   <p>After this event, some contestants reached back out to share their experiences. This is what one said, “Thank y’all for hosting this project—I learned a lot about synthetic biology. I never really even knew it was a field of study until IGem. This was my first “science fair” you could say since elementary school, and I’ve never been in a science competition like this before. I hope y’all continue hosting this challenge next year because it was a lot of fun!” <br>
   From the projects the students pitched to us, it was clear that their knowledge of synthetic biology was quite limited before this event. Many students shared that they initially knew almost nothing about synthetic biology as a disclaimer before their presentation nor how prevalent it has become in today's world. However, through our presentation and by encouraging them to explore current synthetic biology projects, they were able to expand their understanding. They also expressed that they appreciated the creative aspect of this science, which differed from the more memorization-based learning typical in school. This experience gave them an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a meaningful and enjoyable way.

   <p>In the future, we hope to reach an even larger audience. Holding this event during the American school year (roughly September to May) might have been more effective, as schools could better advertise and encourage participation. Since our challenge started in July, many students have been out of school and not checking school announcements. Additionally, making the project more group-based would be ideal. One submission came from a group of students who collaborated, and this seemed particularly effective. They were able to focus on individual aspects of the project while still learning about all parts. This better reflects how science progresses - through teamwork rather than just individual effort.</p>

   <p>Since this was our first in-person outreach project, we looked for advice from an expert on how to best structure it. We met with Anjula Batra, the Instructional Development Assistant Director at the University of Rochester’s Teaching Center. She loved our idea of using a plant—something familiar to everyone—and making it personal to introduce aspects of synthetic biology. While not an expert in synthetic biology herself, she suggested incorporating 3D materials for the kids to add to their plants, rather than just having them draw. She noted that for younger children, creativity might be more challenging if they only had markers or crayons. She also recommended providing pre-cut accessories, like wings, paws, or ears, for the kids to add to their flowers. <br>
    In addition to teaching synthetic biology, we wanted to include information about other sciences. So, we added details about how flowers grow and created an interactive diagram with flip sections that revealed what plants need to grow and the outcomes of photosynthesis. This also acts as an activity that can be changed for different age groups by providing different levels of difficulty and understanding.  </p>

<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>As a part of our outreach and education efforts, we created and presented activities to children enrolled in the Rochester Science and Museum Center Curosity Camp. On Day 1, we based our activity on climate change by showing the effect of carbon dixode. The activity involved mixing vinegar and baking soda together in a water bottle that was closed off by a small balloon. As the reagents mixed, carbon dioxide was produced, which blew up the balloon, and we had the kids wrap their hands around it for a few minutes to show carbon dioxide will trap heat. We then incorporated our own project into how we can solve this problem and gave them the basics of how synthetic biology can be used.</p>

   <p>To plan our activities, we started by focusing on the core of our project by explaining why we developed it and the problems we aim to solve. We decided to begin by addressing climate change, helping the kids understand why our project is important. We wanted the activity to be both hands-on and visual. While students often learn about climate change in school and hear about how excess carbon dioxide is harmful to the environment, we wanted to show them this in a more tangible way. We chose the classic baking soda and vinegar experiment but with a twist. We covered the bottle with a balloon, so the students could see the gas being produced. To demonstrate how carbon dioxide traps heat, we had each child wrap their hands around their own bottle for a few minutes, then discussed why this isn’t good for the planet. <br>
   We started by asking the kids what they knew about climate change and whether they thought it was good or bad. After a discussion, we shifted the focus to synthetic biology. We asked if anyone had heard of synthetic biology or could guess what it meant. After providing a simplified explanation, we encouraged the kids by asking, "Can you think of ways we could modify bacteria to help the planet? Draw a picture of your bacteria with its new superpower!" <br>
   Along with drawing their bacteria, we took inspiration from our "STEAM Fair" activity and used any extra time to let them craft their own bacteria and flowers using pipe cleaners.

<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>On our second day of working with the Rochester Museum and Science Center Summer Camp, we based our activity on synthetic biology. In order to teach a complex topic to our students who ranged from 9-11 years old, we designed a “create your own flower” activity, in which students used their understanding of synthetic biology to design a flower with any features or super powers they could imagine.</p>

We decided to show off some fun designs on our poster board that were made by members of the team, which quickly interested the students and motivated them to create their own unique flowers. Additionally, since we had more time for this activity, we decided to ask the students a few questions, such as “Do you think that cats can glow?” and “Does anyone know what genes are?” to get them thinking about our activity. <br>
  <strong>Feedback - </strong> The students were intrigued by our discussion on synthetic biology and While conducting the activity, the team walked around and asked students to explain what type of flower they were designing.</p>

<!-- INSERT IMAGES HERE -->
<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5052/education/westsidemarket-intro.jpeg" alt="">
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>We hosted our own booth at the Westside Farmers Market, where we shared an activity with the children and presented our project to the adults. The farmers market provided a great opportunity to engage with a diverse audience, representing various educational backgrounds. For the third time, we ran the 'Make Your Own Flower' activity, which encouraged kids to think about synthetic biology as they designed their own flowers. This time, we enhanced the activity by offering more pre-made objects and setting all the items out infront of the children, allowing the children greater creative freedom in their projects.</p>

   <h4><strong>Increase Community Awareness of Synthetic Biology</strong></h4>
   <p>Raise awareness about synthetic biology among market-goers and demonstrate how it can be applied to the real-world in a simple, engaging manner. Build relationships with market organizers and attendees, with the goal of being invited back for future outreach events as we were last year.</p>
   <h4>Target Audience</h4>
   <p>Rochester community. Since the farmers market attracts people of all ages, we aimed to make our booth accessible to a wide range of age groups and backgrounds. We designed the activity to be engaging and enjoyable for everyone, from toddlers to senior citizens.</p>

   <p>Similar to previous activities, we wanted to encourage the children to think creatively about designing their own unique flower and even imagining a new plant species. To give them as much creative freedom as possible, we gathered all the supplies we had used throughout the summer, including googly eyes, gems, and cut-out shapes like circles, rectangles, and cloud-like figures from Day 3 of the RMSC activity. We laid everything out on the table and in a bin, allowing the children to freely explore and choose what inspired them. This approach let them see all the available materials and use their imagination, rather than limiting them to specific items we deemed useful. <br>
   We also prepared different levels of dialogue depending on the age of the children. For toddlers, we focused on the simple concept of making their own flower, encouraging them to create whatever they wanted. For elementary school students, we added examples of what real scientists have done with synthetic biology, like making a cat glow using jellyfish genes. For middle and high school students, we planned to go into more detail about the GFP gene inserted into the cat and explained how different parts of DNA allow us to perform these kinds of modifications. While the craft activity remained the same for all age groups, each child could design their flower with as much detail as they wished.</p>

   <p>Overall, the children enjoyed the activity and were excited to have something fun to do. The parents appreciated that their kids were entertained while they explored the market. Some of the new plant species the children created included names like 'Super Pinky Pink' and 'Mr. Cool.' However, only children under 8 years old interacted with us, so we didn’t have the opportunity to see how older kids would have responded to the activity.</p>

   <p>In the future, we'd like to offer even more 3D shapes and objects for the children to use, such as popsicle sticks and pipe cleaners. We also want to provide scrap paper so they can cut out their own shapes; however, we were unable to do this due to a lack of scissors at this time. Additionally, we plan to have two separate tables—one for displaying all the supplies and another as an open workspace for the children. This would help prevent overcrowding, as the single table became quite cramped during the activity.</p>

   <p>For this presentation, we needed to frame our research in the context of how much science has advanced, even in just the last twenty years. We began with the basics of synthetic biology and gradually built up to more complex aspects of our project. To engage a broader audience, we included not only the scientific details but also ethical considerations, in case some seniors had little background or interest in science. Additionally, we adjusted the physical format of our presentation to accommodate the needs of the senior audience. This included using large, easy-to-read text for visibility and providing enough written information on the slides to support those who might have difficulty hearing us.</p>

   <p>Our presentation to the senior citizens went quite differently than expected. Much of our time was spent answering their insightful questions about our project, as they were curious about how we planned to address specific challenges. It turned out that many of the seniors had strong backgrounds in science and engineering, having worked for Kodak, a major company founded in Rochester that produced film and related products and was a key employer in the area until the early 2000s. As a result, they asked advanced questions such as, 'What’s the point of redistributing carbon out of the atmosphere?' and 'Why can't you just use algae from lakes outside?' <br>
   From the feedback forms we provided, most of the senior citizens expressed that they enjoyed learning about our research and appreciated our reasoning behind it. However, some felt that we could have included more background information for better context.

   <p>In the future, we plan to  provide more foundational science background for those who may not be as familiar with the subject. We also want to allocate even more time for a Q&A session and perhaps include a “thoughts” section where we share challenges we're facing and invite their input. Additionally, we realized the importance of framing our project clearly, highlighting both its ability to generate electricity and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While we were aware of this the whole time, it's easy to overlook key points when you're so familiar with the project. This will be extremely valuable to remember for our final presentation at the Jamboree.</p>

<p>In July, our iGEM team had the amazing opportunity to collaborate with the University of Rochester's Upward Bound program, introducing local high school students to the world of synthetic biology. We covered the basics, shared real-world examples, and taught them how to plate bacteria. They even created their own glowing bacterial art while learning the science behind it.</p>

   <p>To prepare for this event, our team observed a professor conducting a gel electrophoresis activity with another group of high school students. He demonstrated how dyes move through the gel, similar to how DNA would be used in actual lab settings. He explained how specific characteristics of DNA make this technique possible. We liked how the activity was hands-on, giving every student the opportunity to engage. We also appreciated that while the activity didn’t prove anything scientifically, it effectively translated to real-world lab methods. However, we did notice that the students seemed less engaged when they weren’t actively participating in the hands-on portion. <br>
    Taking this into account, we decided to design our activity around streaking bacteria on plates—a practical and fun skill for high schoolers, especially since many of us didn’t get to plate bacteria until college. To make the activity even more exciting, we engineered the bacteria to express GFP (green fluorescent protein), providing a real-world example of synthetic biology in action. This demonstrated to the students that synthetic biology isn’t a foreign concept, but something used in everyday science. <br>
    To spark creativity and keep them engaged, we encouraged the students to create bacterial "art" on the plates. We started with a demonstration of the proper plating technique, then showed them how to make different patterns and write words. <br>
    For the educational component, we used Kahoot! as an interactive tool to introduce the background of our project. Between questions, we provided additional explanations about synthetic biology, making sure to keep the students engaged. This approach was a fun alternative to traditional slides or packets, especially since it was summer and we didn’t want the students to feel like they were stuck in a typical classroom setting. At the end of the session, we asked the students to get into groups and discuss a problem in the world and how they might use synthetic biology to solve it. This was to get the students thinking in our iGEM state of mind.

   <p>Overall, the students thoroughly enjoyed working with real bacteria and creating their own bacterial art. They were excited to see the final results, which we shared with them by emailing pictures once the bacteria had grown overnight. Many commented that they felt like true scientists, especially when using a flame and handling actual bacterial cultures. <br>
   The Kahoot! quiz was also a hit as everyone was eager to participate, keeping track of who was answering correctly and anticipating who would win by the end. However, the students seemed less engaged when we asked them to brainstorm their own synthetic biology project ideas. Instead, they mostly chatted among themselves. We encouraged them to use the internet to research past problems solved by synthetic biology and even suggested looking at previous iGEM projects, but this didn’t spark as much interest as we had hoped.

Additionally, we ended up with more time than anticipated during the "create your own synthetic biology idea" portion. Next time, we might introduce another simple hands-on activity for students to work on after they finish their bacterial art, making better use of the extra time.</p>

   <p>For the cards, we included both pictures and definitions to appeal to different learning styles. The definitions are a blend of easy-to-understand concepts with some higher-level learning, ensuring that both beginners and those with a science background can take something away from the game.

   <p>To develop our social media posts, we aimed to create scientific content that was both easy to understand and educational. We also wanted to highlight the connections between science and everyday life, showing how it surrounds us, often unnoticed. As a result, we focused not only on synthetic biology but also science applications that we found most interesting to share. <br>
    Each post was tailored to be able to engage different audiences and appeal to a broader spectrum of viewers rather than just individuals focused on science. For example, in our post on synthetic biology applications, we discussed its role in developing COVID-19 vaccines, which resonates with both science enthusiasts and the general public, given the global impact of the pandemic. We also explored the use of synthetic biology in Impossible Meat, another plant-based alternative to traditional meat. These diverse topics were linked through their relevance to synthetic biology but appeal to general audiences. <br>
    In addition to the content, we prioritized the visual appeal of our posts to attract more followers. We focused on incorporating images, rather than relying solely on text, to capture audience attention. We also wanted our team’s colors to be present throughout our posts and create a pleasing feed that would bring back users to our page.

<h1 id="Conclusion"><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
<p>Team CyanoVolt successfully organized a series of educational activities that engaged both the Rochester community and a global audience. By focusing on creativity and environmental themes, we demonstrated how synthetic biology can be integrated into everyday life to make a positive impact. Our creation of the SynBio Innovation Challenge introduced high schoolers worldwide to synthetic biology and encouraged them to apply it to solve real-world problems they were passionate about. Locally, our collaboration with Upward Bound inspired first-generation and low-income students to explore the possibilities of science while teaching them practical lab techniques with a creative twist. Additionally, our outreach to younger children through the Rochester Museum and Science Center’s Curiosity Camps and a local STEAM Fair introduced them to synthetic biology and the climate crisis in an approachable way, using everyday items like flowers. At the Westside Farmer’s Market and Highlands Senior Center, we connected with community members, sharing insights about our project and its future applications. Our new game, SynBio Fish, reinforces the idea that science can be both fun and educational. Finally, our social media efforts were critical in spreading awareness about synthetic biology and keeping individuals updated on our own project progress. We hope that our work inspires the public to embrace creativity and recognize the unlimited possibilities within science.</p>
